Resource_Repacker_P.pak

Mod Version: 1.2

Author: AgentKush

Compatible with Icarus: All Weeks

Mod Type: EXMOD

## Description:
Adds 21 crafting recipes that repack raw resources back into unopened UDA resource kits. Available at every player crafting bench plus handcrafting (player inventory). Recipes mirror the kit's vanilla byproduct (e.g. 100 Titanium_Ore -> 1 Titanium kit), so the mod is purely logistics, not duplication. Lets you ship raw resources back to space and redeploy them at another base.

BASIC RESOURCES
  - Wood Kit       250 Wood
  - Stone Kit      250 Stone
  - Dirt Kit       50 Dirt

DLC (Dangerous Horizons)
  - Ruby Kit         50 Ruby Ore
  - Uranium Rod Kit  10 Uranium Rod
  - Ren Kit          100 Ren

DLC kits are feature-gated to Dangerous Horizons - on non-DLC installs the recipes do not register at all, so there are no broken-icon recipes. The DLC requirement is also shown in the kit's tooltip in the crafting bench. The other 18 work for all players.

## Available At
Every crafting bench AND handcrafting (player inventory):
  Character (handcrafting), Crafting_Bench, Anvil_Bench (T1/T3/T4), Armor_Bench (T1/Advanced/Electric), Carpentry_Bench (T1/T4), Masonry_Bench (T1/T3/T4), Machining_Bench, Fabricator, Manufacturer, Alteration_Bench (T1/Advanced), Chemistry_Bench, Glassworking_Bench, Herbalism_Bench, Medicine_Bench, Animal_Bench, Butchery_Bench (T1/Advanced), Kitchen_Bench (T1/Advanced), Trophy_Bench, Rustic_Decorations_Bench, Fishing_Bench_Recipes.

Ver 1.2
Feature-gated DLC recipes (Ruby/Uranium Rod/Ren) using Metadata.RequiredFeatureLevel: DangerousHorizons - they no longer register on non-DLC installs. Fixes broken-icon / no-item-produced issue reported on v1.1. Added DLC requirement note to each DLC kit's tooltip.

Ver 1.1
Added 3 DLC kit recipes (Ruby, Uranium Rod, Ren) - require Dangerous Horizons. Exposed every recipe at all player crafting benches plus handcrafting (Character).

Ver 1.0
Initial release. 18 repack recipes covering Basic, Metal, and Exotic resource kits. Neutral 1:1 input/yield ratios.

## Files Modified:
  Crafting-D_ProcessorRecipes  (21 entries - repack recipes)
  Traits-D_Itemable            (3 entries - DLC kit tooltip overrides)

## Installation:
  1. Install JimK72's Icarus Mod Manager
     https://github.com/jimk72/IcarusModManager
  2. Download Resource_Repacker.EXMODZ
  3. Import via Mod Manager

## Notes:
  - Recipe input quantity matches the VANILLA kit yield. Stack-size mods do not change this.
  - Recipe row names match the kit name 1:1. Safe - no vanilla recipe row collision.
