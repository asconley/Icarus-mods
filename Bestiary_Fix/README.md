Fixes missing experience events that prevent Bestiary point tracking for several creatures.

Requires **[JimK72's Icarus Mod Manager](https://github.com/Jimk72/Icarus_Software)**

## The Problem

Several creatures are missing experience events in the game data, which prevents the Bestiary from tracking kills and other actions. Additionally, the Sulfuric Spider's SkinningXPEvent incorrectly references a Kill event instead of a Skin event.

**Important caveat:** Sulfur Worm, Sulfur Vesper, Cave Worm, and Vesper all explode on death and leave no corpse. This means skinning-related Bestiary actions (Skin, SkinWithTrophyKnife, SkinOnBench) are impossible by design. The Bestiary point tracking for these creatures may also be partially broken at the engine level (C++ blueprint code) which data table mods cannot fix. This mod addresses the data table issues only.

## What This Mod Fixes

### Data Table Fixes

| Table | Entry | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| D_ExperienceEvents | Kill_SulfurWorm | **Added** - was completely missing, preventing any kill tracking |
| D_AICreatureType | GeothermalSpider | **Fixed** SkinningXPEvent from Kill_Geothermal_Spider to Skin_Geothermal_Spider |

### Known Limitations

These issues exist at the engine/blueprint level and cannot be fixed with data table mods:

| Issue | Reason |
|-------|--------|
| Exploding creatures can't be skinned | Death blueprint destroys corpse - no skinning possible |
| Bestiary may not register kills for some DH creatures | Engine-level creature-to-bestiary mapping may be broken |
| Trophy crafting may not award Bestiary points | CraftTrophy tracking is hardcoded in C++ |

### How Bestiary Points Work

| Action | Points | Available for exploding creatures? |
|--------|--------|------------------------------------|
| Kill | 3 | Requires Kill event to exist (this mod adds Kill_SulfurWorm) |
| Skin | 2 | No - corpse destroyed |
| Skin with Trophy Knife | 4 | No - corpse destroyed |
| Skin on Bench | 4 | No - corpse destroyed |
| Craft Trophy | 4 | Maybe - depends on engine tracking |
| Scanned | 6 | Yes |
| KilledBy | 4 | Yes |
