**10× detection range** for the Cave Scanner and Fish Finder — locate caves and fishing spots from far further out. Companion to Extended Deep Ore Scanner Range.

Requires **[JimK72's Icarus Mod Manager](https://github.com/Jimk72/Icarus_Software)**

## Changes

| Scanner | Vanilla Range | Modded Range |
|---|---|---|
| Cave Scanner | 300m | **3000m (3km)** |
| Fish Finder / base scanner | 150m | **1500m** |

The Fish Finder inherits the base scanner range, so patching the base extends it (and any other scanner without its own range override).

## How It Works

PAK mod patching `MaxScanningRange` in `BP_ActionableBehaviour_Scanner_Cave` (30000 → 300000 cm) and `BP_ActionableBehaviour_Scanner` (15000 → 150000 cm). Same-size in-place blueprint byte-patches.

## Installation

Install via JimK72's Icarus Mod Manager.

## Multiplayer

All players AND the server must have this mod installed.

## Changelog

### v1.0
- Initial release
- 10× Cave Scanner range (300m → 3000m) and 10× base/Fish Finder range (150m → 1500m)
