## Overview

Always shows player-built structures on the map and minimap without requiring any special stats or radar. Buildings will always display the home icon on both the world map and compass.

## Features

### Map Visibility

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| World Map Icon | ✅ Always visible |
| Minimap Icon | ✅ Always visible |
| Compass Display | ✅ Always visible |
| Radar Required | ❌ Not needed |

## How It Works

By default, Icarus requires the `MapCanSeeBuildings` player stat (typically from a radar or talent) to see your buildings on the map. This mod removes that requirement, so your bases and structures are always visible.
