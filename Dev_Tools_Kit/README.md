## Important Notes

- These are **internal developer tools** - some may have limited or unexpected functionality
- **Thor's Hammer** and **Transform Tool** are the most useful for players
- **Bug Tool** connects to RocketWerkz's internal Jira - won't work for players
- **Deployable Dropship** may have placement restrictions
- Some tools' in-hand meshes have been substituted with visible placeholders so you can see the tool in your hand (Inspection Tool uses the Deep Ore Scanner mesh, Bug Tool uses the Beacon Tool mesh, Transform Tool uses the Building Hammer mesh)
- **Debug Target** is a deployable dummy used by the devs to test weapon damage and effects

## Compatibility

| Mod | Status |
|-----|--------|
| FastProcessing (all variants) | Compatible |
| Workshop Recyclers | Compatible |

| Individual Item Kits | Compatible |
| Other D_WorkshopItems mods | May conflict |

## Version History

| Version | Changes |
|---------|---------|
| 1.1.3 | Audited against live game data. Substituted visible meshes for 3 tools that previously used the invisible placeholder mesh (Inspection Tool → Scanner DeepOre, Bug Tool → Beacon Tool, Transform Tool → Building Hammer). Added Debug Target as the 11th dev tool (dummy target for weapon testing, uses its own visible mesh). Fixed Thor's Hammer Focusable reference (Focusable_2H no longer exists in game data → now uses Focusable_Sledge). |
| 1.1.2 | Updated 3 item icons to match current game data: Unobtainable Tool (→ CrateEquipment icon), Test Seed (→ Red Exotic Seed icon), Deployable Dropship (→ Icarus logo icon). |
| 1.1.1 | Updated 3 item icons to match current game data: Unobtainable Tool (→ CrateEquipment icon), Test Seed (→ Red Exotic Seed icon), Deployable Dropship (→ Icarus logo icon). |
| 1.1.0 | Fixed: Added Item.Meta tags to existing game dev items (Fireball, Inspection Tool, Bug Tool, Pyromancy Flame, Transform Tool) - now all 10 items appear in Workshop |
| 1.0.0 | Initial release - 10 dev tools unlocked |
