The **first-ever mining-laser blueprint mod**. No more stopping to let the laser cool — overclock it for sustained, uninterrupted deep mining.

Requires **[JimK72's Icarus Mod Manager](https://github.com/Jimk72/Icarus_Software)**

## Changes

| Value | Vanilla | Overclocked |
|---|---|---|
| Seconds of use before overheat | 5s | **300s** |
| Cooldown time | 5s | **1s** |

In practice the laser will never overheat during normal mining, and if you somehow push it that far it recovers almost instantly.

## How It Works

A blueprint (PAK) mod that byte-patches the `SecondsToReachMaxHeat` and `SecondsToCooldown` FloatProperties in `BP_Actionable_MiningLaser`. Bundled as cooked `.uasset`/`.uexp` files that the Mod Manager merges into the game pak. Nobody has modded an individual tool blueprint like this before.

## Installation

1. Install JimK72's Icarus Mod Manager
2. Import `Mining_Laser_Overclock.EXMODZ`
3. Rebuild the merged mod and restart Icarus

## Changelog

### v1.0
- Initial release
- Overheat threshold 5s → 300s, cooldown 5s → 1s
