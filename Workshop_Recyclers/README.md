## Overview

Introduces two dedicated recycling machines that enable full material recovery from both Workshop purchases and crafted items, plus an **Incinerator** for instant item destruction. Returns **100% of original Workshop costs** — including Ren, Exotics (purple), Red Exotics, Biomass, and Uranium. Deconstruction stops at processed materials (ingots, refined goods) — no raw ores or pyritic crusts.

## Features

### Biofuel Recycler

| Specification | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| Base Machine | Biofuel Bio-Cleaner (T3) |
| Crafted At | Machining Bench / Fabricator |
| Function | Recycles workshop items into currencies AND crafted items into materials |
| Repair Materials | Electronics (hammer repairable) |

### Organic Residue Recycler

| Specification | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| Base Machine | Organic Residue Cleanser (T4) |
| Crafted At | Fabricator |
| Function | Recycles workshop items into currencies AND crafted items into materials |
| Repair Materials | Electronics (hammer repairable) |

### Incinerator

| Specification | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| Base Machine | Electric Furnace visual |
| Crafted At | Fabricator / Manufacturer |
| Function | Instantly destroys any item — no output |
| Power | Electric (2,500 mW) |
| Unlock | Requires Organic Recycler talent |
| Recipes | 3,054 items (every item in the game) |

### Combined Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Recipes | 5,340 |
| Workshop Items Recyclable | 335 |
| Crafted Items Deconstructable | 1,948 |
| Incineratable Items | 3,054 |

## Currency Returns

Workshop items return **100% of their original replication cost** as physical items:

| Workshop Currency | Returns As | Count |
|-------------------|------------|-------|
| Credits only | Ren | 195 |
| Exotics (purple) only | Meta_Resource | 12 |
| Credits + Exotics | Ren + Meta_Resource | 74 |
| Red Exotics only | Exotic_Red | 15 |
| Credits + Red Exotics | Ren + Exotic_Red | 21 |
| Biomass + Credits | Biomass + Ren | 8 |
| Uranium + Credits | Uranium_Rod + Ren | 8 |
| Uranium only | Uranium_Rod | 2 |

### How It Works

Workshop currencies cannot be directly output by processor recipes (the game engine silently drops `D_MetaCurrency` outputs). This mod maps each currency to its physical item equivalent:

| Currency | Physical Item | Data Table |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| Credits | Ren | D_ItemTemplate |
| Exotic1 (purple) | Meta_Resource | D_ItemTemplate |
| Exotic_Red | Exotic_Red | D_ItemTemplate |
| Biomass | Biomass | D_ItemTemplate |
| Exotic_Uranium | Uranium_Rod | D_ItemTemplate |

### Example Returns

| Item | Original Cost | Returns |
|------|---------------|---------|
| Basic Envirosuit | 25 Credits | 25 Ren |
| Module Tracker | 50 Credits + 10 Exotics | 50 Ren + 10 Meta_Resource |
| Inaris Alpha Axe | 400 Exotics | 400 Meta_Resource |
| Shengong Echo Axe | 150 Red Exotics | 150 Exotic_Red |
| Shengong Delta Bow | 250 Credits + 50 Red Exotics | 250 Ren + 50 Exotic_Red |
| Sandworm Inhaler | 100 Credits + 10 Biomass | 100 Ren + 10 Biomass |
| Bulky Armor Head | 100 Credits + 75 Uranium | 100 Ren + 75 Uranium_Rod |

## Gameplay Notes

- Returns **100% of original replication costs** as physical items
- Items costing multiple currencies (e.g. Credits + Exotics) return both as physical items
- Deconstruction returns processed materials — **no raw ores or pyritic crusts**
- A Steel Pickaxe returns Steel Ingots, not Metal Ore
- Enables inventory cleanup with zero loss
- Strategic for managing Workshop credit and exotic economy
- Useful for recovering materials from outdated gear
- **Incinerator** instantly destroys any item — covers every item in the game (3,054 recipes)
- Incinerator crafted at Fabricator (20 Steel Ingot, 10 Electronics, 40 Concrete Mix, 4 Glass)
- Note: FPS may dip while the Incinerator UI is open due to recipe count — returns to normal when closed
- All three machines repairable with Electronics + any hammer

## Version History

| Version | Changes |
|---------|---------|
| 5.5 | **Full incinerate coverage.** Added 886 missing recipes (frozen wood, frozen ore, raw ores, food, building pieces, seeds). 3,054 total incinerate recipes — every item in the game. Fixed icon (invalid asset path), mesh (non-existent reference), and tech tree overlap. |
| 5.4 | **Incinerator fixes:** Fixed missing tech tree icon (invalid asset path), fixed placement issue (non-existent mesh reference), repositioned tech tree nodes to avoid overlap with vanilla T4 Fabricator items. |
| 5.3 | **New machine: Incinerator.** Electric-powered processor that instantly destroys any item with no output. 2,168 incinerate recipes covering every recyclable/deconstructable item. Crafted at Fabricator/Manufacturer. Unlocked after Organic Recycler. |
| 5.2 | **Crash fix:** Fixed EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION crash caused by incorrect DataTableName references in v5.1 recipes. All recipe outputs now correctly use D_ItemTemplate, all inputs use D_ItemsStatic. Fixed 130 input RowName mismatches from new recipes using D_ItemTemplate names instead of D_ItemsStatic names. |
| 5.1 | Added 158 new recipes: 6 mission items (Gyro, Navigation, Thruster, Enzyme Storage, High-Tech Assembled, Recombined Tech), 10 DLC items (Lava Hunter trophies, Homestead decor), 29 national flags, 18 missing workshop items (Carbon Armor Alpha/Beta, Larkwell White armor, Shengong hammers/sickles, Biolab inhalers, Inaris items, 9Diamonds Shield), 30 food recipes, 16 furniture/decor, 13 armor/equipment, 10 stations/deployables, 26 misc (fertility serums, saddles, platinum tools, building pieces). All Deconstruct recipes return 100% crafting materials. All 333 workshop items now covered. |
| 5.0 | **Complete rebuild:** Fixed root cause of all currency outputs failing — processor recipes cannot output D_MetaCurrency, so all 317 workshop recycle recipes now output physical items (Ren, Meta_Resource, Exotic_Red, Biomass, Uranium_Rod) via D_ItemTemplate. Regenerated all 1,808 deconstruct recipes from current game data using ItemStaticData lookup. Removed 30 raw ore and pyritic crust deconstruct recipes, stripped ore/crust outputs from 33 more — deconstruction now stops at ingots and refined materials. All crafting times matched to base game. Zero broken references. |
| 4.7 | Fixed MetaResource currency outputs, added 285 new Recycle_ recipes. |
| 4.6 | Fixed 47 recipes to return correct exotic items. |
| 4.5 | Added 60 new recycle recipes for DLC workshop items. |
| 4.4 | Fixed 135 recipe output references. |
| 4.3 | Game update compatibility fix — fixed 57 broken input refs, 12 broken output refs, removed 62 deleted items, added 12 new recipes. |
| 4.2 | Repair fix — both recyclers now hammer repairable with custom D_Durable entry. |
| 4.1 | Week 213+ compatibility update. |
| 4.0 | Major update — 100% workshop cost returns, fixed 74 currency refs, 28 name typos. |
| 3.0 | Major cleanup — fixed 63 broken item references, removed 136 invalid recipes. |
