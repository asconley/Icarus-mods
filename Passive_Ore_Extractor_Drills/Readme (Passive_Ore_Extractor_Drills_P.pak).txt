Mod Version: 7.6

Author: AgentKush

Compatible with Icarus: All Weeks

Mod Type: EXMOD

## Description:
23 passive ore extractors - one per ore type. Place anywhere, connect power, load Stone. Uses drill-visual processor for passive mining.


Ver 7.6
Fixed broken deployment - BP_PassiveMiner blueprint files were missing from v7.5 EXMODZ package. Miners can now be placed again.

Ver 7.5
Fixed broken Fabricator recipes - Iron_Ingot/Copper_Ingot replaced with correct Refined_Metal/Refined_Copper. Fixed Aluminium miner - was outputting ingots (Aluminium), now correctly outputs Bauxite ore with proper icon. Added Manufacturer bench as crafting station for all miner kits.

Ver 7.4
Added Fabricator crafting recipes - all 23 miners craftable in-game without Workshop. Tiered material costs: common (Steel+Electronics), uncommon (+Glass), rare (+Titanium+Carbon Fiber), exotic (+Composite Paste).

Ver 7.3
Fixed collision/interaction - machines are now solid and interactable again. DeployableSM set to bVisible=false (invisible) but keeps StaticMesh for collision hitbox. DeployableSK renders the animated drill visual - no double mesh, working physics.

Ver 7.2
Fixed double mesh rendering - removed static mesh from DeployableSM so only the animated skeletal mesh renders. BROKEN: Removing StaticMesh also removed collision - machines became ghost objects.

Ver 7.1
Fixed broken drill textures - swapped furnace materials to drill materials (M_DEP_DeepMiningDrill_Electric Off/On). Fixed sounds - swapped furnace FMOD audio to drill sounds (SFX_DEP_ELECTRIC_DRILL_ACTIVE/STOP). Added drill animation - skeletal mesh with Anim_DEP_DeepMiningDrill_Electric_Active.

Ver 7.0
Complete rewrite using BP_PassiveMiner (renamed Electric Furnace with drill mesh swap). No longer overrides any vanilla blueprints - unique BP at /Game/BP/../PassiveMiners/BP_PassiveMiner. Processor functionality via BP_ResourceNetworkProcessor inheritance (place anywhere, no ore deposit needed).

Ver 6.0
Attempted re-parenting drill BP from BP_Drill_Base to BP_ProcessorBase. Crashed with 'Could not find SuperStruct ActiveStateUpdated' - BP_Drill_Base functions not in BP_ProcessorBase.

Ver 1.0
Initial development - experimented with Electric Furnace approach, ore node spawners, and data-only configs.
