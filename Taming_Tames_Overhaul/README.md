Tame faster, breed faster, and grow your animals quicker — across all 29 tameable creatures. No combat-stat changes, so it stays compatible with difficulty mods.

Requires **[JimK72's Icarus Mod Manager](https://github.com/Jimk72/Icarus_Software)**

## Features

- **3x faster taming** — `TameDurationInSeconds` cut to a third on every tameable creature (Moa / Buffalo / Horse 15 min -> 5 min, wolves 10 min -> ~3 min, Mammoth / Raptor 30 min -> 10 min).
- **2x faster breeding** — `GestationPeriodSeconds` halved.
- **Double juvenile chance** — `PercentChanceToSpawnJuvenile` doubled (capped at 100%).
- **Easier to keep happy** — the food (`DesiredNutritionPercentage`) needed during taming is halved.
- **Faster mounts** — `Husbandry_MountSpeed` talent boosted to 20% (from 5%), and `Husbandry_RidingEfficiency` doubled so riding costs less O2/food/water.
- **Faster tame growth** — the Well-Fed (Guided Growth) feeding XP (`Tame_Fed`) tripled, so juveniles mature sooner.

## Why no HP / damage buffs?

Tamed combat stats come from the Guided Growth talent and per-creature base stats — buffing those would collide with **Creature Difficulty Scaling** and **Hardcore Rebalance Pack**. This mod sticks to the taming / breeding loop so it layers cleanly with the rest of the collection.

## Files Modified

- `AI-D_Tames` (29 entries)
- `Experience-D_ExperienceEvents` (1 entry — `Tame_Fed`)

## Version History

- **v1.1** - Added faster mounts (Husbandry_MountSpeed 5%->20%) and cheaper riding (Husbandry_RidingEfficiency doubled).
- **v1.0** - Initial release. 3x taming, 2x breeding, double juvenile chance, half taming food, 3x tame-growth XP.
