## Description

Massively overhauls creature difficulty to scale with high-level play. This mod transforms all 161 spawn zones across every biome to support creature levels up to 500, applies tiered stat buffs to 136 creatures, adds player-level-based scaling rules for dynamic difficulty, and now includes a full affliction system, epic creatures, exotic loot, and biome temperature modifiers.

Designed as the combat companion to level cap mods — without this, creatures cap at level 120 even when players can reach 500.

## What This Mod Does

### 1. Spawn Zone Level Scaling (161 zones)
All spawn zones across Olympus, Styx, Prometheus, and Elysium have been rescaled:

| Zone Difficulty | Vanilla Range | Modded Range |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| Starter/Outpost | 1-30 | 2-100 |
| Easy | 10-50 | 27-200 |
| Medium | 30-60 | 100-250 |
| Hard | 50-80 | 200-350 |
| Very Hard | 70-100 | 300-437 |
| Super Hard | 80-120 | 350-500 |
| Endgame (Icesheet/Ashlands) | 100-120 | 437-500 |

### 2. Creature Stat Buffs (136 creatures)
Percentage-based buffs applied by creature threat tier:

| Tier | HP | Damage | Resistance | Regen | Speed |
|------|-----|--------|------------|-------|-------|
| Passive (Deer, Rabbits, etc.) | +25% | — | — | +15% | — |
| Small Predator (Wolves, Spiders) | +50% | +30% | — | +25% | +5% |
| Medium Predator (Bears, Jaguars) | +100% | +50% | +15% | +50% | +8% |
| Boss (Mammoths, Sandworms) | +75% | +40% | +20% | +30% | — |

### 3. Player-Level Scaling Rules
Dynamic scaling rules that scale creature stats based on nearby player level:

| Scaling Rule | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Health | +5% per player level (up to +2500% at level 500) |
| Damage | +3% per player level (up to +1500% at level 500) |
| Resistance | +2% per player level (capped at +50%) |
| Speed | +1% per player level (capped at +25%) |
| Per-Player (multiplayer) | +75% per additional nearby player |

**Note:** The player-level scaling rules use the game's built-in `bScaleByAverageNearbyPlayerLevel` system. These rules are defined in D_ScalingRules and are available for any game system that references them. The primary scaling comes from the massively expanded spawn zone levels, which feed into the game's existing creature growth curves.

## Creature Count by Tier

| Tier | Count | Examples |
|------|-------|---------|
| Passive | 38 | Deer, Rabbits, Kea, Sheep, Chamois |
| Small Predator | 25 | Wolves, Spiders, Slugs, Hyenas |
| Medium Predator | 47 | Bears, Jaguars, Scorpions, Landsharks, Crocodiles |
| Boss | 28 | Mammoths, Polar Bear Boss, Sandworms, Rock Golem |

### 4. Affliction System (22 chances + 8 afflictions + 6 modifiers)
Creatures now inflict meaningful status effects during combat:

| Affliction | Chance | Duration | Effect |
|-----------|--------|----------|--------|
| Caveworm Poison | 100% | 40s | Poison damage over time |
| Concussion (Contusion) | 35% | 2400s | From heavy hits (buffalo, etc.) |
| Food Poisoning | 50% | 900s | From contaminated sources |
| Dysentery | 25% | 900s | From dirty water |
| Swamp Parasites | 25% | 600s | Swamp biome hazard |
| Frostnip Escalation | 50% | — | Cold exposure chains |
| Heatstroke Escalation | 50% | — | Heat exposure chains |
| Deep Wound Escalation | 15% | 2400s | Severe bleed progression |

**Stat Afflictions:**

| Affliction | Duration | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Poison | 65s | General creature poison |
| Poison Sting | 35s | Insect/scorpion stings |
| Poison Sting (Stackable) | 20s | Stacks from swarm attacks |

| Sprain | 15s | Fall/impact injury |
| Exotic Debuff | 2500s | Exotic creature encounter |

| Spore Poison | -20% movement speed |
| Sandworm Poison | -35% movement speed |
| Enraged (NPC) | +75 HP, +15% move speed (creature buff) |
| Splint / Workshop Splint | +10% / +20% fall damage resistance |

### 5. Epic Creatures & Exotic Loot
4 new epic creature types with custom loot tables:

| Type | Description |
|------|------------|
| Exotic Infused | Exotic-enhanced creatures |
| Red Exotic Infused | Rare red exotic variant |

### 6. Biome Temperature Modifiers (19 biomes)
Custom temperature curves per time of day across all biomes: Conifer, Arctic, Desert, RiverLands, Desert Canyons, Southern Glacier, and all Styx/Prometheus/Elysium zones.

| Easy Creatures | Reduced creature stats |
| NPC Increase Easy/Medium/Hard | Scaled NPC spawn rates |

## Changelog

### v2.3 — Affliction System & Epic Creatures (DarkAngel Collab)

Adds a full affliction/status effect system to creature combat, plus epic creatures, exotic loot, biome temperatures, and autonomous spawns. Credit to DarkAngel for contributing the affliction system, biome temps, and epic creature additions.

**New tables added:**
- **Affliction Chances (22):** Poison, concussion, frostbite, heatstroke, dysentery, wound escalation, swamp parasites, caveworm poison, and more — creatures now inflict meaningful status effects

- **Autonomous Spawns (6):** Caveworm Spawners, Swamp Gas Flyers, Lava Flyers, Spiders, Wild Beehives, NPC Outposts

### v2.2 — Tame & Mount Survival Pass

**Fixes the "my wolf dies in 3 seconds" problem.**

Prior versions left the Tame_* and Mount_* entries almost untouched — they had a flat 40% damage resistance but zero HP boost and zero melee damage boost. As players progressed into higher-level zones and tougher biomes, tames and mounts couldn't keep up with the scaled-up hostile creatures the mod was already buffing, and were getting shredded.

**What changed:**

| Creature class | HP | Melee | Phys Resist | Other Resists | Regen |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Tames** (6) — Wolf, Cat, Wildboar, Tundra Monkey, Orka, Storca | **+200%** | **+120%** | 40% → **60%** | 40% → **55%** (fire/frost/explosive/poison) | +100% |
| **Mounts** (16) — Horse, Buffalo, Chew, Moa, Raptor, Slinker, Snow Striker, Swamp Bird/Quad, Tusker, Woolly Mammoth, Wooly Zebra, Zebra, BlueBack, Bull | **+150%** | unchanged (mounts don't fight) | 40% → **55%** | 40% → **50%** | +75% |

Tames can now hold their own against scaled-up hostile creatures in open combat. Mounts are much harder to kill out from under you when riding through a pack.

**Not touched:** Mount_SpeederBike (it's a mechanical vehicle, not a creature), NPC companions, livestock (Pig, Sheep, Cow, Chicken, Lamb, Piglet, Rooster) — those stay vanilla since they're farm animals, not combat pets.

**DLC coverage confirmed:** CDS currently covers 100% of creatures in New Frontiers (Prometheus lava creatures), Styx (Geothermal biome, drones, Reavers), Dread (Irradiated mutations), and all juvenile/boss variants. No DLC creatures are missing.

### v2.1
- Added 44 new creature growth entries for taming/mount content (dogs, horses, mounts, juveniles, tamed pets, speeder bike)
